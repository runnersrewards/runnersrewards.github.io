                  Craig is a seasoned Software Engineer with over 20 years of commercial experience and a lifelong passion for running. He started running at the age of 18 in 2004 and has since participated in nearly 300 races, ranging from 200 meters to 30 kilometers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Specialising in the 800 meters on the track, Craig also competes in the 1500 meters, 3000 meters, and cross-country events. While he occasionally takes part in road races like 5Ks and 10Ks, he now focuses more on shorter distances. A dedicated member of Team Bath Athletics Club, Craig trains regularly at Bath University and competed in the 800 meters and 1500 meters at the 2023 British Indoor Masters Championship.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His passion for running extends beyond competition. Through his YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SwiftTrailsTV" target="_blank">Swift Trails</a>, Craig shares virtual treadmill running experiences recorded with his GoPro, inspiring runners worldwide to stay motivated and explore new routes from the comfort of their treadmills.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2019 Craig played a role in the INEOS 1:59 Challenge, where Eliud Kipchoge became the first person to run a sub-two-hour marathon. As part of a team of athletes, he tested pacing formations by running 400m intervals at sub-two-hour pace. Their efforts, filmed using drones and other tech, helped refine the 'Y' formation ultimately used during Kipchoge's historic run.
